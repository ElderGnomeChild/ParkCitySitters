# Web Apps Project Fall 2019 - Westminster College

A collaborative project between design and development students to create a Web App. We are working with Park City Sitters to make a system to streamline the babysitter user experience.<br><br>
This project is a web app developed with Park City Sitters as part of the Web Apps class at Westminster College. On the site, administrators are able to post jobs and create new clients. Babysitters are able to pick up jobs that administrators have made. This project was worked on for half of a semester, about a month and a half. We were not able to get "feature complete", but we did produce something worth showing in a portfolio as an example of ability and quality of work.
